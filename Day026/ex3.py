"""
Instructions
Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

1
2
3
and file2.txt contained:

2
3
4
result = [2, 3]
IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension
instead of a Loop.

Example Output
[3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]

with open('file1.txt') as data:
    data1 = data.read().split('\n')

with open('file2.txt') as data:
    data2 = data.read().split('\n')

result = [int(n) for n in data1 if n in data2]
# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)
