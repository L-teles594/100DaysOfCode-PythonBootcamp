Instructions
In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge. First, convert this function is_leap()
so that instead of printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year." it should return True if it is a leap year and return
False if it is not a leap year.

You are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month as inputs, e.g.

days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
And it will use this information to work out the number of days in the month, then return that as the output, e.g.:

28
The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year. A leap year
has 29 days in February.
